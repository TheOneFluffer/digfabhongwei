				<h2>Web Development Assignment</h2>
				<p>Document how to create a basic website for the module, with navigation bar and links for the
					different topics.</p>
				<br>
				<h2>What is HTML</h2>
				<p>The "!DOCTYPE html" declaration defines that this document is an HTML5 document</p>
				<br>
				<p>The "html" element is the root element of an HTML page</p>
				<br>
				<p>The "head" element contains meta information about the HTML page</p>
				<br>
				<p>The "title" element specifies a title for the HTML page (which is shown in the browser's title bar or
					in the page's tab)</p>
					<br>
				<p>The "body" element defines the document's body, and is a container for all the visible contents, such
					as headings, paragraphs, images, hyperlinks, tables, lists, etc.</p>
					<br>
				<p>The "h1" element defines a large heading</p>
				<br>
				<p>The "p" element defines a paragraph</p>
				<br>
				<p>To create a link to a website, you can use "a href="url">link text /a" to create a hyperlink for
					users to click on for them to jump to another page</p>
					<br>
				<p>To create the Navigation bar, use the "div" element to create a new container for other HTML elements
				</p>
				<br>
				<p>Use "h3" element to create a header element with size 3 text (The bigger the number, the smaller the
					font size)</p>
					<br>
				<p>Using the "ul" element to create an unordered list and "li" tags to create an item list</p>
				<br>
				<h2>What is CSS</h2>
				<br>
				<p>CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheets</p>
				<br>
				<p>CSS describes how HTML elements are to be displayed on screen, paper, or in other media</p>
				<br>
				<p>CSS saves a lot of work. It can control the layout of multiple web pages all at once</p>
				<br>
				<p>External stylesheets are stored in CSS files</p>
				<br>
				<p>Essentially CSS is used mostly for style in websites</p>
				<br>
				<h2>What is JavaScript</h2>
				<br>
				<p>JavaScript allows you to create animations or allow the webpage to become dynamic (updating data in real time) because it contains JavaScript code, making it smart.</p>
				<br>
				<h2>What is Bootstrap5</h2>
				<br>
				<p>Bootstrap is a free front-end framework for faster and easier web development</p>
				<br>
				<p>Bootstrap includes HTML and CSS based design templates for typography, forms, buttons, tables, navigation, modals, image carousels and many other, as well as optional JavaScript plugins</p>
				<br>
				<p>Bootstrap also gives you the ability to easily create responsive designs</p>
				<br>
				<h2>What is Markdown</h2>
				<br>
				<p>Markdown can be used for everything. People use it to create websites, documents, notes, books, presentations, email messages, and technical documentation.</p>
				<br>
				<p>Markdown is portable. Files containing Markdown-formatted text can be opened using virtually any application. If you decide you don’t like the Markdown application you’re currently using, you can import your Markdown files into another Markdown application. That’s in stark contrast to word processing applications like Microsoft Word that lock your content into a proprietary file format.</p>
				<br>
				<p>Markdown is platform independent. You can create Markdown-formatted text on any device running any operating system.</p>
				<br>
				<p>Markdown is future proof. Even if the application you’re using stops working at some point in the future, you’ll still be able to read your Markdown-formatted text using a text editing application. This is an important consideration when it comes to books, university theses, and other milestone documents that need to be preserved indefinitely.</p>
				<br>
				<p>Markdown is everywhere. Websites like Reddit and GitHub support Markdown, and lots of desktop and web-based applications support it.</p>
				<br>
				<h2>How to deploy website on GitHub:</h2>
				<br>
				<p>Firstly, you create the files needed that you need eg HTML</p>
				<br>
				<p>Next, you open GitHub and put the extension .github.io at the back of the repository</p>
				<br>
				<p>Finally, you upload the files from your computer using either the github desktop app or via the website.</p>
				<br>
				<pp>After that, give it a while to update on the github.io page</pp>
