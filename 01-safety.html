						<strong><u>SPECIFIC SAFETY RULES & REGULATIONS IN FAB LAB AND MACHINE SHOP:</u></strong>
					</p>
					<br>
					<p>It is recommended that you familiarize yourself thoroughly with the operation of the machine and
						adhere strictly to the following safety rules and regulations. If in doubt, please ask the Instructor or Technical Support Officer (TSO). In this way, we can prevent accidents that may result in operator’s injury, costly damage to the machine, or scrapped work-pieces.
					</p>
					<br>
					<ol>
						<li>
							A clean, neat, orderly machine and work area is the first step in safety. Keep all guards and covers in place and all machine cabinet doors closed.
						</li>
						<li>
							Do not operate machines or equipment until you have been properly instructed and authorized to do so by your Instructor/TSO.
						</li>
						<li>
							Do not start the machine or spindle until the work-piece and work-holding devices are securely fastened.
						</li>
						<li>
							During any activity that requires the handling of work-holding devices, tools, measuring devices, or work-piece parts in the cutting zone, the machine’s motors must be in the stationary mode.
						</li>
						<li>
							Know the position of the Emergency Stop push-button of the machine. Activate it during an emergency situation.
						</li>
						<li>
							Do not lean on any moving parts when the machine is in operation.
						</li>
						<li>
							If you must remove hot tooling or sharp tools, switch off the machine and put on the hand gloves.
						</li>
						<li>
							Never clear chips when the spindle is rotating. Never remove chips with your bare hands. Use a brush or tool designed for that purpose.
						</li>
						<li>
							When operating a machine, it requires your undivided attention. No “horseplay” or “monkey about” is allowed in your work area. If you need to attend to another matter, stop the machine until you can give it the full attention required.
						</li>
						<li>
							Be alert for loose, worn, or broken parts and abnormal sounds and noises. When you suspect a problem, do not operate the machine. Report the problem at once to the Instructor or Technical Supporting Officer (TSO) for corrective action.
						</li>
						<li>
							Do not use the machine, if the safety guard is not properly installed.
						</li>
						<li>
							Do not leave any materials lying on the floor. Unwanted materials should be put into the scrap bins.
						</li>
						<li>
							When operating the machine tools, ensure that other workshop users are not exposed to danger.
						</li>
						<li>
							Always use a brush to sweep off all waste materials from the workbench.
						</li>
						<li>
							Do not forget to clean up your workplace and machine tools after each use.
						</li>
					</ol>
					<br>
					<p>

						<strong><u>FIRE EMERGENCY EVACUATION:</u></strong>

						</li>
						<li>
							Quickly and calmly inform the lecturer-in-charge or TSO or follow the SP’s Three-step Emergency Procedure:
